                In TI Program Years Four and Five, milestone incentive payments will be based on performance measures in contrast to the 
                Core Components used in Years Two and Three. Year Four and Five metrics align with various other applications and uses, 
                including the CMS Core Set and Statewide TI measures. For the Year Four and Five Milestones specific to each Area of 
                Concentration, please refer to the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/TargetedInvestments">AHCCCS website</a>.

                        Attribution is done using member referral lists. Members will be included in a TI participant’s denominator if they meet all measure denominator criteria and were referred to the TI-participating organization within the two years prior to the end of the measurement year.

                         The standard HEDIS measures for initiation and engagement of treatment have been replaced with a custom AOD-34 measure.

    <h4 id="just004">Telehealth Inclusion</h4>
    <p>
        Several TI performance measures allow qualifying visits to be conducted via telehealth. AHCCCS adopted telehealth coverage changes pre- and intra-pandemic that require specific procedure code modifiers, rather than place of service “02” (telehealth). Therefore, the TI team has taken steps to ensure that all telehealth visits are counted accurately for measure evaluation.
    <p>
        Encounters that fit any one of the three criteria below will be counted as telehealth:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Place of service = “02” (telehealth)
            </li>
            <li>
                The encounter has a procedure code listed on the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/TelehealthCodeSet_COVID.xlsx">AHCCCS telehealth code set</a> with the “GT” or “GQ” procedure code modifier, a qualifying place of service, and service date on or after 1 Oct 2019.
            </li>
            <li>
                The encounter has a procedure code listed on the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/TelehealthCodeSet_COVID.xlsx">AHCCCS temporary telephonic code set</a> with the “UD” procedure code modifier and service date on or after 17 Mar 2020.
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Per the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/COVID-19EmergencyMedicalCodingGuidance.pdf">AHCCCS COVID-19 Emergency Medical Coding Guidance</a>, the place of service for these visits is the originating site (i.e., where the member is located at the time of the telephonic service delivery).

    <h4 id="just005">Performance Measurement Targets</h4>
    <p>
        An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established the targets. The committee considered National Medicaid Performance, AHCCCS Historical Performance, TIP Historical Performance, AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standards (MPS), and TI Fiscal Year 2019 and 2020 performance to determine TI Year 5 targets. The identity of the TI participants was blinded.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A single target was established for each measure. To qualify for the performance incentive, Organizations must improve from their performance level in the baseline year to meet or exceed one of the two options below, whichever is lowest:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The target established for the measure, OR
                </li>
                <li>
                    10%-points above the Organization’s performance in the baseline year.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                If an Organization’s baseline performance is above the target, they must maintain performance above the target in the measurement year in order to qualify for the performance incentive.
            </li>
            <li>
                Examples of this logic:
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The AOD measure has a target of 78%.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provider A has a performance of 65% in the baseline year. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization must improve to equal to or greater than 78% in the measurement year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provider B has a performance of 60% in the baseline year. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization must improve to equal to or greater than 70% in the measurement year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provider C has a performance of 85% in the baseline year. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization must maintain performance equal to or greater than 78% in the measurement year.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
                Tiers and targets may differ across AOCs for the same measure. These differences accommodate variation in attribution methodologies.
