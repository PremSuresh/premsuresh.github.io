                The AHCCCS Targeted Investments Program (TIP) Quality Improvement Collaborative (QIC) evaluates TI-participating Providers’ 
                performance on select quality measures and assists providers in performance improvement efforts. 
                As a result, we have developed process audit guides for TI-participating Providers to assist with 
                evaluating their quality improvement (QI) systems, as well as measure specific guides.

                In TI Program Years Four and Five, milestone incentive payments will be based on performance measures in contrast to the Core Components 
                used in Years Two and Three. Year Four and Five metrics align with various other applications and uses, including the CMS Core Set and 
                Statewide TI measures. For the Year Four and Five Milestones specific to each Area of Concentration, please refer to the 
                <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/TargetedInvestments">AHCCCS website</a>.

    <p>
        The Provider Identification Method and Attribution Methods directly affect which members each Provider is held accountable for.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <h5>Provider Identification Method</h5>
            Read the summary below or, for detailed explanation and examples, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/leR6XhqKG8I">Provider Identification Methodology</a> video (<a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/Y5_Provider_ID_Methodology_Change_v6.pdf">slides</a>).
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Year 4
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attribution was done at the level of billing provider ID, with results summed to the TIN level.
                    </li>
                    <li>Members from non-TI sites that used a TI-participating billing ID were included.
                    </li>
                    <li>This led to non-TI members being included in TI denominators during attribution.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Year 5
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attribution is done at the level of billing and servicing provider ID.
                    </li>
                    <li>This adds more granularity to the data analysis and a greater ability to exclude members seen at non-TI sites.
                    </li>
                    <li>This change may impact attributed members (denominator) as well as measure compliance (numerator).
                    </li>
                    <li>The revised methodology was accounted for in setting the Year 5 targets.

                        <li>
                           Member will be attributed to all BH providers who have treated the patient for this condition (i.e., provided service with a diagnosis of mental illness) during the 12-month reporting period.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <i>Diabetes Screening for People with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Member will be attributed to all BH providers who have treated the patient for this condition (i.e., provided service with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder) during the 12-month reporting period.
                         </li>

                            <u>Example:</u> A member/patient with Schizophrenia regularly sees a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) (or Psychologist) for ongoing care and also occasionally sees a Psychiatric NP (or Psychiatrist) for prescription of antipsychotic medication. If a diabetes screening test is completed in the CY, the LCSW (or Psychologist), the Psychiatric NP (or Psychiatrist), and the PCP who completes the diabetes screening test will get credit for the measure. For specific codes, see the <a href="measures.html">HEDIS resources</a>.

                        <li>
                            Attribution is based on each hospitalization episode. The episode will be attributed to all BH providers with whom there is a qualifying follow up visit as well as all TI-participating BH providers with whom the member had a visit in a 90 day window prior to the hospitalization.

    <p>
        Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is an approach to behavioral health integration recognized by CMS.
        <ul>
            <h5>Recognition in TI Program</h5>
            An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established how the CoCM services (i.e., codes 99492, 99493 and 99494) are recognized in the TI Program.
                <ul>
                     <li>
                         <em>PCP measure evaluation (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> Collaborative codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).

                      <li>

                          <em>BH measure evaluation & attribution (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> In post-discharge period, CoCM codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed). In period prior to hospitalization (i.e., 90 days prior), CoCM codes will qualify the BH provider in denominator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).
                       </li>

            To maximize CoCM services for FUH compliance, the following may be useful in guiding how your organization bills for these services. This guidance was developed and validated by subject matter experts in CoCM billing and coding from AHCCCS and other organizations. It does not conflict with CoCM billing guidelines from CMS.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Providers may submit only one CoCM claim per member per calendar month.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All CoCM services factored into a claim must have been provided in the calendar month.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The date of service on the submitted CoCM claim must be within the calendar month in which the services were provided. The coding guidelines do not otherwise dictate which date in the month must be listed. Therefore, the date of service can be the date of the first service, the date of a subsequent service that month, and the last day of the month are all allowed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                             The CoCM claim date of service, in relation to the most recent hospital discharge date, determines how many days passed between hospital discharge and the provided follow up service.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

<h4 id="dash007">Telehealth Inclusion</h4>
<p>
    Several TI performance measures allow qualifying visits to be conducted via telehealth. AHCCCS adopted telehealth coverage changes pre- and intra-pandemic that require specific procedure code modifiers, rather than place of service “02” (telehealth). Therefore, the TI team has taken steps to ensure that all telehealth visits are counted accurately for measure evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    Encounters that fit any one of the three criteria below will be counted as telehealth:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Place of service = “02” (telehealth)
        </li>
        <li>
            The encounter has a procedure code listed on the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/TelehealthCodeSet_COVID.xlsx">AHCCCS telehealth code set</a> with the “GT” or “GQ” procedure code modifier, a qualifying place of service, and service date on or after 1 Oct 2019.
        </li>
        <li>
            The encounter has a procedure code listed on the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/TelehealthCodeSet_COVID.xlsx">AHCCCS temporary telephonic code set</a> with the “UD” procedure code modifier and service date on or after 17 Mar 2020.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Per the <a href="https://www.azahcccs.gov/PlansProviders/Downloads/MedicalCodingResources/COVID-19EmergencyMedicalCodingGuidance.pdf">AHCCCS COVID-19 Emergency Medical Coding Guidance</a>, the place of service for these visits is the originating site (i.e., where the member is located at the time of the telephonic service delivery).
            </li>
        </ul>
</ul>

<h4 id="dash008">Performance Measurement Tiers & Targets</h4>
<p>
    An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established the tiers and targets. The committee considered National Medicaid Performance, AHCCCS Historical Performance, TIP Historical Performance, AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standards (MPS), and TI Fiscal Year 2019 performance to determine TI Year 4 tiers and targets. The identity of the TI participants was blinded.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Two to four tiers are established for all measures. To qualify for the performance incentive, Organizations must improve from tier in baseline year to next higher tier in measurement year (top tier to maintain).
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Organizations in the lowest tier in the baseline year must meet or exceed the above target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Organizations in a middle tier in the baseline year must meet or exceed the above target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. For example, for the Well-Child Visits (Ages 3-6 Years), Peds PCP organizations between 60% and 85% in the baseline year must meet or exceed 85% to qualify for the performance incentive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Organizations in the highest tier, the tier above the high target, in the baseline year must stay above the high target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Tiers and targets may differ across AOCs for the same measure. These differences accommodate variation in attribution methodologies. 
            </li>
        </ul>
