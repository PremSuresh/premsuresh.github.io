Beginning October 1, 2018, a large number of members moved from RBHA to ACC plans. The FUH measures require members to be enrolled from the date of discharge through 30 days after discharge. All of these members would have had qualifying enrollment as of October 30, 2018, but only a small fraction of them would have had a qualifying hospitalization event in that period. The number of qualifying hospitalizations increases linearly as more months of data are taken into account, and levels off one year later (September 2019) because the data are evaluated on a 12-month basis.

Therefore, for dual payer patients, if TI Participant submits claims to both Medicare and Medicaid, then the TI Participant receives credit for TI Program measures even when Medicare pays the full claim.

                                A:Members who meet the SSD denominator criteria are attributed to the BH providers with whom the member had a visit with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder during the measurement year. It does not require the provider to conduct the diabetes screening themselves. This performance measure reflects coordination of care for high-risk individuals. If a practice does not provide diabetes screening services, this measures your ability to refer/ follow-up with the member to ensure screening is completed.

Our organization is a Direct Support Provider (DSP), but another Health Home (HH) or Qualified Service Provider (QSP) is responsible for post-hospitalization follow up appointments for many of our members.

                        A: Yes, for TI performance measurement you will held responsible for all members served under your participating provider IDs. DSP/QSP/HH designation is not factored into TI attribution. Aligned with the care coordination objectives of the TI Program, you are encouraged to coordinate with the QSP to ensure that follow up takes place. TI attribution methods may differ from health plan attribution methods. For details on TI attribution methods, see <a href="dashboard.html#dash005">Measure Evaluation & Attribution Methods.</a>
