    <h4 id="meas009">Collaborative Care Model Inclusion</h4>
    <p>
        Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is an approach to behavioral health integration recognized by CMS.
    </p>        
        <div class="indent-left"><b>Recognition in TI Program</b>
            <p>
            An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established how the CoCM services (i.e., codes 99492, 99493 and 99494) are 
            recognized in the TI Program.
                <ul>
                     <li>
                         <em>PCP measure evaluation (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> 
                         Collaborative codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).
                       </li>
                      <li>
                          <em>PCP attribution:</em> CoCM codes will <u>not</u> be included among E&M codes or other qualifying visit in 
                          PCP attribution process.
                       </li>
                      <li>
                          <em>BH measure evaluation & attribution (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> 
                          In post-discharge period, CoCM codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types 
                          (licensed and non-licensed). In period prior to hospitalization (i.e., 90 days prior), CoCM codes will qualify the BH 
                          provider in denominator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).
                       </li>
                    <li>
                        TIP does not recognize the newest HCPCS code G2214 as a qualifying follow-up after hospitalization service, as G2214 is 
                        not an AHCCCS reimbursable code in any TI program year.

        <b>Billing Guidance</b>
        <div class="FUH">
        <p>
            To maximize CoCM services for FUH compliance, the following may be useful in guiding how your organization bills for these services. 
            This guidance was developed and validated by subject matter experts in CoCM billing and coding from AHCCCS and other organizations. 
            It does not conflict with CoCM billing guidelines from CMS.
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Providers may submit only one CoCM claim per member per calendar month.
                </li>
            <li>
                All CoCM services factored into a claim must have been provided in the calendar month.
                </li>
            <li>
                The date of service on the submitted CoCM claim must be within the calendar month in which the services were provided. 
                The coding guidelines do not otherwise dictate which date in the month must be listed. Therefore, the date of service 
                can be the date of the first service, the date of a subsequent service that month, and the last day of the month are all allowed.
                </li>
            <li>
                The CoCM claim date of service, in relation to the most recent hospital discharge date, determines how many days passed 
                between hospital discharge and the provided follow up service.
                </li>

        <p>
        An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established the tiers and targets. The committee considered National Medicaid Performance, AHCCCS Historical

        targets. The identity of the TI participants was blinded. Tiers and targets may differ across AOCs for the same measure. These differences accommodate 
        variation in attribution methodologies. For your organization’s specific targets, please see your dashboard or the email received from 
        the AHCCCS TI team.

                <ul>
                    <li>Organizations in the lowest tier in the baseline year must meet or exceed the above target for the measurement year

            <ul>
                <li>A single target was established for each measure. To qualify for the performance incentive, Organizations must improve 
                    from their performance level in the baseline year to meet or exceed one of the two options below, whichever is lowest:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The target established for the measure, OR
                    </li>
                    <li>10%-points above the Organization’s performance in the baseline year.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>If an Organization’s baseline performance is above the target, they must maintain performance above the target in the 
                    measurement year in order to qualify for the performance incentive.
                </li>
                <li>Examples of this logic:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The AOD measure has a target of 78%.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provider A has a performance of 69% in the baseline year, which is less than 10%-points below the target. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization 
                        must improve to equal to or greater than the 78% target in the measurement year.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provider B has a performance of 60% in the baseline year, which is more than 10%-points below the target. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization 
                        must improve to equal to or greater than 70% (10%-points above baseline) in the measurement year.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provider C has a performance of 85% in the baseline year, which is above the target. To qualify for the performance incentive, the Organization 
                        must maintain performance equal to or greater than the 78% target in the measurement year.
