            <h4>Performance Measurement Tiers & Targets</h4>
            <p>
               An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established the tiers and targets. The committee considered National Medicaid Performance, AHCCCS Historical Performance, TIP Historical Performance, AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standards (MPS), and TI Fiscal Year 2019 performance to determine TI Year 4 tiers and targets. The identity of the TI participants was blinded.
            <p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                         Two to four tiers are established for all measures. To qualify for the performance incentive, Organizations must improve from tier in baseline year to next higher tier in measurement year (top tier to maintain).
                      </li>
                   <ul>
                         <li>
                           Organizations in the lowest tier in the baseline year must meet or exceed the above target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. 
                       </li>
                          <li>
                           Organizations in a middle tier in the baseline year must meet or exceed the above target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. For example, for the Well-Child Visits (Ages 3-6 Years), Peds PCP organizations between 60% and 85% in the baseline year must meet or exceed 85% to qualify for the performance incentive. 
                       </li>
                           <li>
                           Organizations in the highest tier, the tier above the high target, in the baseline year must stay above the high target for the measurement year to qualify for the performance incentive. 
                       </li>
                           <li>
                           Tiers and targets may differ across AOCs for the same measure. These differences accommodate variation in attribution methodologies. 
                       </li>
                    </ul>

                    Attribution methodology for BH providers depends on the measurement criteria.

                <li>
                    A standard treating physician attribution methodology has been modified to the group level.

                    <i>Metabolic Monitoring for Children and Adolescents on Antipsychotics</i>

                        <li>
                           Member will be attributed to all BH providers who have treated the patient for this condition (i.e., provided service with a diagnosis of mental illness) during the 12-month reporting period.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <i>Diabetes Screening for People with Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications</i>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Member will be attributed to all BH providers who have treated the patient for this condition (i.e., provided service with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder) during the 12-month reporting period.
                         </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Example:</u> A member/patient with Schizophrenia regularly sees a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) (or Psychologist) for ongoing care and also occasionally sees a Psychiatric NP (or Psychiatrist) for prescription of antipsychotic medication. If a diabetes screening test is completed in the CY, the LCSW (or Psychologist), the Psychiatric NP (or Psychiatrist), and the PCP who completes the diabetes screening test will get credit for the measure. For specific codes, see the HEDIS resources on the <a href="measures.html">Measures page</a>.

                        <li>
                            Attribution is based on each hospitalization episode. The episode will be attributed to all BH providers with whom there is a qualifying follow up visit as well as all TI-participating BH providers with whom the member had a visit in a 90 day window prior to the hospitalization.

            <h4>Collaborative Care Model Codes</h4>
            Psychiatric Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is an approach to behavioral health integration recognized by CMS. An AHCCCS Committee in consultation with CHiR established how the CoCM services (i.e., codes 99492, 99493 and 99494) are recognized in the TI Program.

                         <em>PCP measure evaluation (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> Collaborative codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).
                       </li>
                      <li>
                          <em>PCP attribution:</em> CoCM codes will <u>not</u> be included among E&M codes or other qualifying visit in PCP attribution process.
                       </li>
                      <li>
                          <em>BH measure evaluation & attribution (i.e., 7/30-day follow up after hospitalization for mental illness measures):</em> In post-discharge period, CoCM codes will count as a qualified visit for numerator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed). In period prior to hospitalization (i.e., 90 days prior), CoCM codes will qualify the BH provider in denominator for all servicing provider types (licensed and non-licensed).
